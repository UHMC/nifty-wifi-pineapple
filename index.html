<p>The WiFi Pineapple is a powerful penetration testing tool that began development in 2008. The WiFi Pineapple may be utilized to gather network intelligence, target and track Wi-Fi devices, and may even be deployed as a rogue access point. Functionality of the WiFi Pineapple is largely dependent on third-party modules that are written and maintained by community members—Hak5, the company behind the WiFi Pineapple, does not maintain responsibility for the modules even though staff work to assist in continuity in times of updates.
<br>
Since development began in 2008, the Wi-Fi Pineapple has undergone several iterations. The two most recent versions are the WiFi Pineapple NANO and the WiFi Pineapple TETRA. Differences between the two devices are outlined below:

<h2 id="target-audience">Target Audience</h2>
<h3 id="wifipineappletetra">WiFi Pineapple TETRA</h3>
<p>While the majority of the options will be similar across the TETRA and the NANO, this assignment has been created for the WiFi Pineapple TETRA. Instructions may differ if being attempted on the Pineapple NANO due to the slimmer design and MicroSD expansion requirement to compensate for low internal storage. </p>

<h3 id="os">Operating System: Windows</h3>
<p>This primer is written and intended for Windows machines, specifically Windows 10. Instructions may differ on older versions of Windows or alternative operating systems such as Mac or Linux. If on a device utilizing something other than Windows this primer may still be read for concept even though configuration settings will be different. </p>

<h2 id="setup">Getting Started</h2>

<h3 id="upgrade-firmware">Upgrading Firmware</h3>
<p>It’s important to upgrade the firmware to achieve optimal performance both with the device and in module operations. To upgrade the firmware, follow the below directions: </p>
<ol>
  <li value="1"> Download the latest firmware from the Hak5 website at https://www.wifipineapple.com/downloads and verify the checksum. </li>
  <li value="2"> Use the provided USB-Y adapter to connect from the ETH1 port on the Pineapple to a computer.  </li>
  <li value="3"> From Chrome or Firefox, browse to http://172.16.42.1:1471 </li>
  <li value="4"> Follow the onscreen instructions to complete the firmware upgrade. </li>
  <ul>
    <li> Onscreen instructions will instruct you to browse and select the firmware upgrade file downloaded and will prompt setup of establishing the root user password, Open SSID, & other functionality settings. Settings may be adjusted later from the menu. </li>
    <li> If the WiFi Pineapple has been previously used and does not prompt for an update, ensure internet connectivity and navigate to the ‘Advanced’ menu and select “Check for Upgrades.” </li>
    <li><img src="./index_files/screenshots/firmwareupgrade.png" alt="Image of the wifi pineapple dashboard showing firmware upgrade" height="450"></li>
  </ul>
</ol>

<h3 id="verify-firmware">Verify Firmware Version</h3>
<ol>
  <li>From the ‘Advanced’ tab above the “Check for Upgrades” button the Current version will be identified. Compare the version number stated with the website at https://www.wifipineapple.com/downloads#tetra. </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="internet-sharing">Internet Sharing</h3>
<p>There are four main methods Hak5 identified to setup internet on the WiFi Pineapple. The instructions below serve to guide through Internet Connection Sharing for lab purposes. Methods of setup include: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Wired Internet Connection </li>
  <li>Internet Connection Sharing </li>
  <li>USB Tethering from Android </li>
  <li>WiFi Client Mode  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="internet-connection-sharing">Internet Connection Sharing</h3>
<ol>
  <li value"1">Connect the WiFi Pineapple TETRA to the PC via the USB-Y adapter. </li>
  <li value"2">Navigate to the “Network Connections” Control panel by typing “ncpa.cpl” into the search bar or through the menus. </li>
    <img src="./index_files/screenshots/ncpacpl.png" alt="ncpa.cpl utility" height="40">
  <li value"3">Identify your current Wi-Fi connection and the connection from the WiFi Pineapple.</li>
  <li value"4">On the active connection being received by the PC right click and select properties. </li>
  <li value"5">Select the ‘Sharing’ tab and check the box for “Internet Connection Sharing.” In the drop-down box select the WiFi Pineapple connection. Select OK. </li>
    <img src="./index_files/screenshots/intsharing.png" alt="Internet sharing" height="200">
  <li value"6">On the WiFi Pineapple Connection right click and select properties. </li>
  <li value"7">Choose IPv4 from the list and press ‘Properties.’ </li>
      <img src="./index_files/screenshots/ipv4.png" alt="ipv4 option from pineapple wifi network" height="350">
  <li value"8">Manually set the IP address to “172.16.42.42” and leave the Subnet mask as the default. Press OK. </li>
      <img src="./index_files/screenshots/setip.png" alt="set the ip on the pineapple" height="350">
  <li value"9">Navigate to the WiFi Pineapple web client from Firefox or Chrome by browsing to http://172.16.42.1:1471 and sign-in using the Root password. From the Dashboard, select “Load Bulletins from Hak5” to verify internet connectivity. If the bulletins to not load then the WiFi Pineapple TETRA is not connected to the internet and does not have full functionality. </li>
  <li value"10">If the WiFi Pineapple TETRA has difficulty connecting try these steps again by disallowing the connection sharing, re-establishing the connection, and re-setting the static IP on the WiFi Pineapple.  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="verify-checksum">Verify Checksum (Optional)</h3>
<p>			Checking the hash file of downloads is important to ensure that the file downloaded is the same as an untampered file as intended by developers and has not been corrupted. If a file has been altered by a third party the hash value will be different from the value provided by the developer. Verifying a hash value may be considered a weak form of data integrity as verification does not verify the file origin. None the less, verifying hash values where available is good practice. The way outlined is merely one of many ways in which checksum may be verified:   </p>
<ol>
  <li value="1">  Open Command Prompt. 	 </li>
  <li value="2">	Navigate to where the file is downloaded.  </li>
  <li value="3">	Run the command, “CertUtil -hashfile upgrade-2.6.2.bin SHA256.”  </li>
    <img src="./index_files/screenshots/sha256.png" alt="sha256 per command line" height="60">
  <li value="4">	Compare the hash of the downloaded file against the hash supplied by the developer.   </li>
    <img src="./index_files/screenshots/dlsha256.png" alt="Given hash value" height="45">
  <li value="5">In this case, the downloaded and anticipated checksums match.   </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="assignment-instructions">Assignment Instructions</h2>
<p>	The assignment steps below will walk you through installing Evil Portal, cloning portals from kbeflo, and connecting with an external device to test the portal on your own device.
